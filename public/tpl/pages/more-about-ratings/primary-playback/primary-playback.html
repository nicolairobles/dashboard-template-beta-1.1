        Time frame is very important when we talk about ratings. Media buyers and sellers want to know when people are exposed to content and for how long. This is particularly relevant at a time when consumers can access content from a number of platforms at any time they choose. In the video and audio realm, we call this the playback period. Generally speaking, this refers to the window of time that an audience is engaged with content.
