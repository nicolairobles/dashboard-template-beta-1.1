        Advertisers use an array of metrics to inform their messaging strategies. Ratings provide the most well-known metricâ€”the number of people exposed to content. Ratings are represented as a percentage of a specific population or audience, and they are often referred to as the currency of the media industry because they are used to price advertising. Once an ad campaign has run, media buyers and sellers review ratings reports to determine if their messaging reached the intended audience.
