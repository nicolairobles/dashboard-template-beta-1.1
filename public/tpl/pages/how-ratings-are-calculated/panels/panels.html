        To comprehensively understand media consumption habits, Nielsen collects opinions and feedback from a curated sample of consumers that is geographically and demographically representative of the population. Nielsen panels are curated groups of consumers who are recruited in person, over the phone, via mail or online to have their media consumption habits measured. Once these consumers agree to become a panelist, or “a Nielsen Family,” we explain how we’ll be measuring their measurement consumption. Nielsen uses various methods for its media measurement, including paper diaries and metering technology. For homes outfitted with meters, our team installs the needed technology on different devices in their homes (depending on the panel) and trains the panelists how to use it. Nielsen data scientists run a number of processes to identify the exact households to recruit for the panels to ensure that they’re representative of the population being measured, accounting for characteristics such as age, gender and ethnicity. Looking at our U.S. television ratings panels, for example, Nielsen uses statistical sampling methods to identify homes that will represent the population of U.S. television households. Nielsen then recruits these randomly selected residents to be a part a Nielsen TV panel. When thinking about panels, it’s important to remember that Nielsen works to curate panels that are representative of the population. This meticulous process and constant upkeep ensures that the panels truly embody consumption habits of a specific population. All Nielsen measurement is under constant supervision to preserve Nielsen’s ratings as market currency. For many products used in the U.S. market, Nielsen engages independent third-party auditors to ensure that appropriate and relevant measure standards are met. Then, Nielsen submits these products to the Media Ratings Council (MRC) for accreditation. In other countries, Nielsen engages with joint industry committees to ensure that the relevant measurement standards for that country are met. Let’s review the panels and technology used to measure television, digital and audio.

      <h4>NIELSEN TELEVISION PANELS</h4>
      <p>In the U.S., Nielsen’s TV panels provide ratings data for both national and local television. As the name denotes, national television refers to TV programming that is broadcast and viewed across the U.S. Local television refers to TV programming that is broadcast and viewed in a select region in the U.S. To ensure local markets are effectively measured and represented in the sample, Nielsen created 210 geographic areas in the U.S., called Designated Market Areas™ (DMAs), in which local television viewing is measured. DMA data are essential for marketers, researchers and organizations seeking to utilize standardized geographic areas within their businesses. The DMAs are ranked based on the number of TV households in that market area. For instance, the New York DMA is ranked No. 1 because it has the largest amount of TV households. Nielsen’s U.S. television panel is used to provide national ratings and local ratings for 56 of the largest DMAs. The local markets in the national panel are sampled at a rate that enables reliable measurement at the local level. Data from these homes also are included in the national ratings. Nielsen uses four methods to measure national and local television.</p>
      
      <p>*Table for People Meter, Set Meter, Code Reader, Diary, with short definitions</p>

      <p>People meters, set meters and code readers listen for specific codes, called watermarks, which are a unique sounds inaudible to the human ear. These codes are embedded into the audio of all measured programs and ads by TV stations as they air their programming. When a program or ad plays on the screen, Nielsen’s meters will note the specific watermark and which households viewed the content. This code tells Nielsen what is being viewed as well as when it’s viewed. This informs what playback period this tuning should be included in. At the same time, the meters and readers also record a portion of the audio from the program being watched, creating a “signature” that can be used as backup to identify the program airing in case there is an issue with the watermark. If needed, Nielsen will compare this portion of audio to a library of programs collected from TV networks to identify the program. These four methods allow Nielsen to measure what is being viewed via a television. The next question is, “Who is tuning in?” Nielsen deciphers this in different ways, depending on the meter/reader being used.</p>

      <p>*Table for People Meter, Set Meter, Code Reader, Diary, with definitions</p>

      <p>To ensure that all markets in the U.S. are measured, Nielsen maintains four panels across all 210 markets.</p>

      <p>In addition to providing the core measurement for television, metered household panels act as truth sets, or calibration sources, for big data sets that often do not have any demographic information associated with them. Panelists are extensively trained to provide accurate data and the thoroughly interviewed to gather demographic information on the household.</p>

      <p>Nielsen’s use of panel and census data provides insight into who is watching, what they’re watching and when they’re watching. With the explosion of big data, it is more important than ever before for the media industry to have access to a representative, accurate data set to calibrate the large amounts of anonymous data circulating.</p>

      <h4>NIELSEN DIGITAL PANELS</h4>
      <p>The ways people engage with media is changing every day. Today, digital technology allows consumers to consume and engage with content just about anywhere. And this untethered access to information has amplified the need for currency-quality audience measurement. That’s where Nielsen’s digital panels come in.</p>
      <p>Nielsen uses two methods to measure digital audiences.</p>
      <p>*Table for Online Meter, Mobile Meter, with definitions</p>
      <p>These meters measure all activity, including what sites and apps the panelists are viewing and for how long. Similar to Nielsen TV panels, Nielsen uses different techniques to identify who precisely is doing the watching, depending on the meter being used.</p>
      <p>*Table for Online Meter, Mobile Meter, with definitions</p>

      <p>Using this technology and techniques, Nielsen maintains three digital panels to measure online, mobile and cross-platform habits.</p>

      <p>*Table for Nielsen Panels, Cross Platform Homes Panel, Online Panel, Mobile Panel, with definitions</p>

      <p>With the amount of big data available in the digital space, it is more important than ever before to have a standard truth set allowing the industry to equivocally understand what media consumption is happening on digital devices and how audiences are consuming media across platforms.</p>

      <h4>Nielsen Audio Panels</h4>

      <p>Audio remains one of the top platforms used by audiences to consume media. The need for currency- grade measurement utilizing methods such as representative panels is important.</p>
      <p>Nielsen uses two methods to measure terrestrial audio consumption.</p>

      <p>*Table for Portable People Meter, Diary, with definitions</p>
      <p>Portable people meters (PPMs) listen for watermarks, similarly to what TV meters listen for in Nielsen TV panels, which are a unique sounds inaudible to the human ear that are placed on programming transmitted from all measured AM/FM radio stations in the U.S. Radio stations in markets with PPMs encode their signals with this inaudible code. When a panelist tunes into a certain station, Nielsen’s meters will note the code for that radio station that allows Nielsen to tabulate the listening levels or ratings for the radio stations. These two methods allow Nielsen to measure audiences tuned into stations. Similar techniques are used to identify who precisely is doing the listening, depending on the method being used. Knowing Who’s Listening</p>

      <p>*Table for Portable People Meter, Diary, with definitions</p>
      <p>Using this method and techniques, Nielsen maintains two audio panels to measure consumption habits.
      <p><strong>Nielsen Audio Panels</strong></p>
      <p>*Table for Portable People Meter, Diary, with definitions</p>
      <p>These audio panels provide the industry with a truth set to truly understand what consumers are tuning into on a regular basis. Television stations/networks can also encode for PPM measurement.</p>
      <h4>Census-based Measurement</h4>
      <p>Now that we’ve reviewed the first part of Nielsen’s hybrid approach, let’s talk about the second: census- based measurement.</p>
      <p>This tech-based approach allows Nielsen to count each and every time a piece of content or ad is served to a consumer on a digital device, no matter whether the audience is consuming video, audio or text. Nielsen counts each time media is consumed and with help from our data partners and through the use of models based on our panels, Nielsen can estimate demographic information about each view to understand who the audience is in terms of age, gender, education, income level, etc.</p>

      <p>Once Nielsen receives the final counts for who saw the content or media, the panels come back into play. Remember, the panels act as a truth set – Nielsen definitively knows not only WHAT is being tuned to in our panels but WHO lives there. So, these “truth sets” are used to calibrate the census data collected to account for any errors. For instance, what if you share your tablet with your sister? If we measured a digital ad served on the tablet, we might originally conclude that you were served a piece of content when in reality, it was your younger sister. Therefore, we calibrate the data we’ve collected using our panels to account for potential errors like this.</p>

      <p>Both aspects of Nielsen’s hybrid measurement strategy are pivotal to providing a stable and granular solution for the media industry, which counts all markets, platforms and people.</p>
