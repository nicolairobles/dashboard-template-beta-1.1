        Rather than rely on a single data source for its ratings, Nielsen uses multiple data sources that include representative, people-based panel data and tag-based census data to deliver a holistic view of the media industry and its audiences. This means two things: First, Nielsen recruits people across the U.S. to join panels, creating representative samples of audiences, like you, and measures their media consumption habits. Second, we combine media consumption data from these panels with census data from digital devices. Census measurement means we count every time an ad or piece of content is viewed if our technology is placed on the media. Nielsen’s measurement strategy leverages granular big data sets and robust panel data to measure all media consumption and provide stable and representative results. Let’s review both components of Nielsen measurement, starting with panels.
