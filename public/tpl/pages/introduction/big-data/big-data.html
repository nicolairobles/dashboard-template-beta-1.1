        All media players—from marketers to ad agencies to media outlets—rely on consumer data: Who’s consuming media? What are they consuming? How frequently are they consuming it? This critical information empowers agencies, marketers and many other constituents to plan and execute their marketing and media strategies. Nielsen plays a pivotal role in the media industry by providing data metrics and translating big data into actionable insights. Nielsen’s ratings allow the media industry to understand who was exposed to content and advertising. Exposure is often referred to as the “reach” among a specific audience.
