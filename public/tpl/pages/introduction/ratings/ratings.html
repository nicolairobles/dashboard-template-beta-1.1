        In its most basic sense, a rating is the percentage of a specific population that was exposed to a particular piece of content or ad. Media owners and advertisers use ratings to understand the reach of specific content or ad (i.e., how many people watched, saw or heard it), which informs their advertising and marketing decisions. Nielsen provides ratings for content and advertising distributed across traditional television, digital devices and radio.
